This repository is for google data analyst project
-----------


In this project I have downloaded 1 year worth of data into 12 files (1 for each month)
All files were in csv format

To start working on data, I have saved all the files in xlsx format

These files have both qualitative (Name, description etc) and quantitative data

Some quantitavie data are discrete and some are continuous data


-----------
Check data source
R.O.C.C.C. (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited)

I coudn't work on ROCCC as i have downloaded the dataset from given url


----------
I looked into the data to decide if data needs any transformation such as 
  Adding, copying, or replicating data
	Deleting fields or records
	Standardizing the names of variables
	Renaming, moving, or combining columns in a database
	Joining one set of data with another
	Setting a file in a different format 

Cleanup process
  Cleanup unwanted data-
  Remove extra space-
  Check for spelling/typos-
  Check for formatting-
  Check for duplicate-
  Check for blank cells-


Then I have cleaned the data, checked for data integrity, duplicate data, blank cells

Also i have added another column for Ride Length by substracting Endtime/Starttime

---------
I have done the same thing in SQL

To do that I have imported all xlsx file to sql server

All of my queries here
